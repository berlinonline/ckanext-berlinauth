    longDescription: >
      This plugin belongs to a set of plugins for the _Datenregister_ – the
      non-public [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) instance that is part of Berlin's
      open data portal [daten.berlin.de](https://daten.berlin.de/).
      `ckanext-berlinauth` provides a custom authorization model. Among other
      things, access for anonymous users is restricted, file upload is
      deactivated


      The plugin implements the following CKAN interfaces:


      -
      [IAuthFunctions](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/plugin-interfaces.html#ckan.plugins.interfaces.IAuthFunctions)

      -
      [IActions](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/plugin-interfaces.html#ckan.plugins.interfaces.IActions)

      -
      [IMiddleware](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/plugin-interfaces.html#ckan.plugins.interfaces.IMiddleware)


      ## Requirements


      This plugin has been tested with CKAN 2.9.8 (which requires Python 3).


      ## Register-mode


      "Register-mode"  is the implementation for the use case where we have CKAN
      as a separate  "backend" system, only accessible to administrative staff
      who add and  manage datasets. In this scenario, CKAN is called the
      "Datenregister".


      The general authorization model is as follows:


      - Anonymous users have no access to the website
      ([https://datenregister.berlin.de](https://datenregister.berlin.de/)),
      except for the `/about` and `/datenschutzerklaerung`. All requests are
      redirected to the login page.

      - Anonymous has access to a subset of the CKAN API (most GET-able
      functions) and the DCAT API.

      - Logged-in users have restricted access to site and API. 
          - no user list/show (except for self)
          - no vocabulary list/show
          - hide certain groups from `group\_list`, `organization\_list`
          - hide users except self from `group\_show`, `organization\_show`
          - ...
      - File upload has been disabled.


      ## Monitoring, Liveness and Readiness Probes


      The fact that the home page (`/`)  is no longer available to anonymous
      users has implications for  monitoring services such as liveness and
      readiness probes in Kubernetes. If `ckanext-berlinauth` is installed and
      activated, such  services should not point to the home page, but instead
      to a page that  is available to anonymous users as well. A good candidate
      is the info page at `/about`.


      ## Additional Configuration Options


      - `berlin.technical\_groups`: A space-separated list of
      group/organizations that are considered  'technical'. A technical
      organization is one which does not reflect a real-world  organization, but
      has only been introduced to structure permissions. Technical groups are
      hidden for non-sysadmin users.

          berlin.technical\_groups = simplesearch harvester-fis-broker

      - `berlin.public\_pages`: By default, access to the Datenregister is
      restricted to logged-in users. This setting contains a space-separated
      list of paths that should be visible to the public, i.e., to anonymous
      users.

          berlin.public\_pages = about datenschutzerklaerung

      ## Version Numbers for Plugins


      The CKAN API's
      [status\_show](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/#ckan.logic.action.get.status_show)
      method includes a list of plugins as configured in the `ckan.plugins`
      setting. `ckanext-berlinauth` includes an extended version of
      `status\_show`  that also shows the version number of each plugin. This
      assumes that the plugin module defines a `\_\_version\_\_` attribute that
      contains the version number. If there is no `\_\_version\_\_` attribute,
      the version number will be `unknown`:

          {
        "help": "http://ckandev.bln/api/3/action/help\_show?name=status\_show",
        "success": true,
        "result": {
          "site\_title": "Datenregister Dev",
          "site\_description": "",
          "site\_url": "http://ckandev.bln",
          "ckan\_version": "2.9.8",
          "error\_emails\_to": null,
          "locale\_default": "en",
          "extensions": {
            "stats": {
              "version": "unknown"
            },
            "berlintheme": {
              "version": "0.3.6"
            },
            "berlinauth": {
              "version": "0.2.6"
            }
          }
        }
      }
